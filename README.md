# Node.js Live Website

## Contributing

Checkout the git repo and get started:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Once you've installed all the deps and run a build all the html assets are built. To test use:

```
npm start
```

The server *should* auto-reload but it's having some problems :(
  
All contens are in markdown. The main page is `index.md` and all the individual event 
pages are in `events/`

If you have any questions about the events or the website log an Issue :)
